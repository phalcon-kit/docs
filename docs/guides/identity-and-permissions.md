# Identity And Permissions

Phalcon Kit identity is integrated with sessions, JWT, ACL roles, impersonation,
controller permissions, model permissions, CLI tasks, and WebSocket tasks.

Official Phalcon references:

- ACL: https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/acl/
- Security: https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/encryption-security/
- JWT: https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/encryption-security-jwt/
- Sessions: https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/session/

Authorization is evaluated in layers:

```text
authenticated identity and context roles
    ↓
feature grants for controller/action/model
    ↓
optional behavior overrides
    ↓
row-level permission conditions
    ↓
query and response
```

A broader feature grant should not be used to repair an incorrect row
condition. Diagnose the layer that denied access.

## Identity Responsibilities

The identity service handles:

- session-backed login state
- JWT generation and refresh
- current user lookup
- impersonation
- role lists and inherited roles
- context roles such as `guest`, `cli`, `ws`, and `everyone`
- ACL role expansion for permission checks

Application auth controllers can extend the core auth controller and customize
workflow-specific login paths.

```php
final class AuthController extends \PhalconKit\Modules\Api\Controllers\AuthController
{
    public function loginParticipantAction(): bool
    {
        $this->view->setVars($this->identity->getJwt());
        $this->view->setVars($this->loginParticipant($this->getLoginParams()));
        $this->view->setVars($this->identity->getIdentity($this->userExpose));

        $loggedIn = $this->view->getVar('loggedIn') ?? false;
        if (!$loggedIn) {
            $this->setStatusCode(401);
        }

        return $loggedIn;
    }
}
```

Keep unusual login behavior in the app controller while reusing identity,
validation, messages, and response behavior from the core.

## Permission Config

Permissions are config-driven. Features group component permissions and optional
controller behaviors. Roles receive features.

```php
'permissions' => [
    'features' => [
        'manageVote' => [
            'components' => [
                \App\Modules\Api\Controllers\VoteController::class => ['*'],
                \App\Models\Vote::class => ['*'],
            ],
            'behaviors' => [
                \App\Modules\Api\Controllers\VoteController::class => [
                    \PhalconKit\Mvc\Controller\Behavior\Query\Conditions\RemoveDefaultPermissionCondition::class,
                ],
            ],
        ],
        'viewVote' => [
            'components' => [
                \App\Modules\Api\Controllers\VoteController::class => [
                    'find',
                    'find-with',
                    'find-first',
                    'find-first-with',
                ],
                \App\Models\Vote::class => ['find'],
            ],
        ],
    ],
    'roles' => [
        'admin' => [
            'features' => ['manageVote'],
        ],
        'participant' => [
            'features' => ['viewVote'],
        ],
    ],
],
```

Components can be controllers, controller actions, models, model methods, CLI
tasks, or WebSocket tasks.

Use controller class names as the canonical component key. Route-style
controller aliases such as `project-user` are accepted during dispatcher
security checks for compatibility, but class constants are easier to refactor.

Use dash-case for action keys because these names match URLs:

```php
\App\Modules\Api\Controllers\ProjectController::class => [
    'find',
    'find-with',
    'archive-project',
],
```

Existing camelCase action config remains valid. Phalcon Kit normalizes dispatcher
actions and ACL registrations so `findWith` and `find-with` refer to the same
permission action. New docs and generated examples should prefer dash-case.

## Controller Attributes

Controllers may declare permissions with PHP attributes. Attributes are additive:
they compile into the same `permissions` structure shown above, so existing
config-driven features, roles, and inheritance remain valid.

```php
use Phalcon\Http\ResponseInterface;
use PhalconKit\Mvc\Controller\Attributes\AllowRoles;
use PhalconKit\Mvc\Controller\Attributes\AttachBehavior;
use PhalconKit\Mvc\Controller\Attributes\PermissionFeature;
use PhalconKit\Mvc\Controller\Behavior\Query\Conditions\RemoveDefaultPermissionCondition;

#[PermissionFeature('project.view', actions: ['find', 'find-with'])]
#[AllowRoles('admin', actions: '*')]
final class ProjectController extends AbstractController
{
    #[PermissionFeature('project.write')]
    #[AllowRoles(['admin', 'manager'])]
    #[AttachBehavior(RemoveDefaultPermissionCondition::class, roles: 'admin')]
    public function archiveProjectAction(): ResponseInterface
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Method-level attributes without `actions` use the method name after removing the
`Action` suffix. In the example above, `archiveProjectAction()` maps to
`archive-project`. Class-level attributes without `actions` apply to `*`.

`PermissionFeature` declares which actions belong to a feature; roles still
receive that feature through config:

```php
'permissions' => [
    'roles' => [
        'manager' => [
            'features' => ['project.write'],
        ],
    ],
],
```

`AllowRoles` grants controller actions directly to roles when a small app or a
local workflow does not need a reusable feature. `AttachBehavior` can target
roles, features, or both. When neither `roles` nor `features` is provided, the
behavior attaches for the `everyone` context role.

### Config-First Feature Example

Use this style when permissions are owned centrally and several controllers,
models, tasks, or WebSocket actions share the same feature.

```php
'permissions' => [
    'features' => [
        'project.view' => [
            'components' => [
                \App\Modules\Api\Controllers\ProjectController::class => [
                    'find',
                    'find-with',
                    'find-first',
                    'find-first-with',
                ],
                \App\Models\Project::class => ['find'],
            ],
        ],
        'project.manage' => [
            'components' => [
                \App\Modules\Api\Controllers\ProjectController::class => ['*'],
                \App\Models\Project::class => ['*'],
            ],
            'behaviors' => [
                \App\Modules\Api\Controllers\ProjectController::class => [
                    RemoveDefaultPermissionCondition::class,
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],
    'roles' => [
        'admin' => [
            'features' => ['project.manage'],
        ],
        'researcher' => [
            'features' => ['project.view'],
        ],
    ],
],
```

### Attribute-First Feature Example

Use this style when the controller owns its own action surface but roles should
still receive reusable features through config.

```php
#[PermissionFeature('project.view', actions: [
    'find',
    'find-with',
    'find-first',
    'find-first-with',
])]
#[PermissionFeature('project.manage', actions: '*')]
#[AttachBehavior(RemoveDefaultPermissionCondition::class, features: 'project.manage')]
final class ProjectController extends AbstractController
{
    #[PermissionFeature('project.manage')]
    public function archiveProjectAction(): ResponseInterface
    {
        // archive-project
    }
}
```

The remaining config only assigns features to roles:

```php
'permissions' => [
    'roles' => [
        'admin' => [
            'features' => ['project.manage'],
        ],
        'researcher' => [
            'features' => ['project.view'],
        ],
    ],
],
```

### Direct Role Attribute Example

Use direct role attributes for small controllers or local actions that are not
worth turning into global feature names.

```php
final class ProjectController extends AbstractController
{
    #[AllowRoles(['admin', 'manager'])]
    public function archiveProjectAction(): ResponseInterface
    {
        // archive-project
    }

    #[AllowRoles('admin', actions: ['restore', 'force-delete'])]
    public function restoreAction(): ResponseInterface
    {
        // restore
    }
}
```

Direct role attributes do not require matching `features` config. The role still
has to be present in the current identity's ACL role list.

### Behavior Example In Both Styles

Action-scoped behavior through config:

```php
'permissions' => [
    'roles' => [
        'admin' => [
            'behaviorActions' => [
                \App\Modules\Api\Controllers\ProjectController::class => [
                    'archive-project' => [
                        RemoveDefaultPermissionCondition::class,
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],
],
```

The same behavior beside the action:

```php
final class ProjectController extends AbstractController
{
    #[AttachBehavior(RemoveDefaultPermissionCondition::class, roles: 'admin')]
    public function archiveProjectAction(): ResponseInterface
    {
        // archive-project
    }
}
```

The existing `behaviors` key is still supported for non-action-scoped behavior
attachment.

Controller attributes use PHP's built-in Reflection API. Supported PHP builds
include Reflection; no extra Composer package or optional extension is required.
Only the active controller class is inspected, and Phalcon Kit caches the result
inside the process. Config-only applications can disable attribute scanning with
`ACL_ATTRIBUTES=false` or config:

```php
'acl' => [
    'attributes' => false,
],
```

## Row-Level Conditions

Feature-level access answers whether a role may use a component. Row-level
conditions answer which records that role may see or change.

Use controller permission conditions for resource-specific scoping:

```php
public function initializePermissionConditions(): void
{
    parent::initializePermissionConditions();

    $this->getPermissionConditions()->set(
        'projectId',
        $this->getProjectIdPermissionCondition('projectId')
    );
}
```

Super roles can bypass row restrictions when the resource explicitly allows it.
Keep that decision local to the resource controller.

## Behavior Overrides

Permission features can attach controller behaviors such as:

- removing the default permission condition for admin-only management screens
- allowing soft-deleted rows while filtering
- changing query behavior for a specific role/feature

Use behavior overrides sparingly. Most resources should keep the default
permission and soft-delete conditions.

## Practical Rules

- Put policy in config, not scattered conditionals.
- Put record ownership rules in controller permission conditions.
- Use role inheritance for broad policy, not copied feature lists.
- Keep guest, participant, CLI, and WebSocket permissions explicit.
- Do not use public issues for security defects. Follow `SECURITY.md`.

graph, [REST APIs](rest-api.md) for query integration, and
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for access-denied and missing-row symptoms.

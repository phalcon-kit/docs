# Phalcon Runtime Upgrades

Use this guide when moving a PhalconKit application or the core package to a
new native Phalcon patch or minor release.

This is separate from the `zemit-cms/core` package rename and the old RESTful
resource migration. Runtime upgrades are mostly dependency, extension,
static-analysis, CI, and compatibility-review work.

## When To Use This

Use this checklist when changing any of these values:

- the installed `phalcon` PHP extension;
- the Composer `ext-phalcon` platform requirement;
- `phalcon/ide-stubs`;
- Docker `PHALCON_VERSION` build arguments;
- CI Phalcon install URLs or extension cache keys.

Keep those changes in one focused commit where possible. Avoid mixing a runtime
upgrade with unrelated model, controller, schema, or API behavior changes.

## Phalcon 5.18.2 Checklist

For the 5.18.2 runtime, align the package on:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "ext-phalcon": "^5.18.2"
  },
  "require-dev": {
    "phalcon/ide-stubs": "^5.18.1"
  }
}
```

The official IDE stubs currently stop at 5.18.1. Phalcon 5.18.2 only changes
the extension distribution archive, so the 5.18.1 stubs are the matching API
surface for the 5.18.2 runtime. Applications that keep `phalcon/ide-stubs` only
under `suggest` or in a separate development tooling package should still use
that floor so IDE and analyzer signatures match the installed extension.

## Local Runtime

Install the native extension first, then verify the CLI PHP runtime that
Composer and QA tools will use:

```shell
php -r 'echo phpversion("phalcon") ?: "not installed"; echo PHP_EOL;'
php --ri phalcon
composer check-platform-reqs
```

If a machine has multiple PHP binaries, run those checks with the same binary
used by Composer, PHP-FPM, Swoole workers, and CLI tasks. Do not rely on web
server PHP and CLI PHP having the same extension version unless both are
checked.

## Composer And Stubs

For PhalconKit core, update tracked Composer constraints and leave ignored
local lock/vendor changes out of the release commit unless the repository
explicitly tracks them.

For applications that track `composer.lock`, update the lock file too:

```shell
composer update phalcon/ide-stubs phalcon-kit/core --with-dependencies
composer check-platform-reqs
```

When preparing Composer metadata before the new extension is installed, the
temporary lock refresh can ignore only the not-yet-installed platform
requirements:

```shell
composer update phalcon/ide-stubs --with-dependencies --ignore-platform-req=ext-phalcon
```

Add other `--ignore-platform-req` flags only for extensions that are unrelated
to the upgrade and genuinely absent from the local CLI PHP runtime. Run
`composer check-platform-reqs` again after the real extension is installed.

If the application does not update `phalcon-kit/core` in the same change, still
update `phalcon/ide-stubs` so Psalm, PHPStan, and IDEs analyze against the same
native API version as the runtime.

## Docker And CI

Update every runtime image and CI pin that installs Phalcon:

- Docker `ARG PHALCON_VERSION`;
- GitHub Actions or other CI `PHALCON_VERSION`;
- PECL or GitHub release tarball URLs;
- extension cache keys that include the Phalcon version;
- image tags or build cache keys derived from PHP and Phalcon versions.

After changing CI pins, confirm the install URL resolves before relying on the
workflow. A redirect from the GitHub release asset URL is enough for the
installer used by this repository.

## Application Compatibility Review

Patch-level Phalcon upgrades are usually small, but PhalconKit applications
should review these recurring integration boundaries:

- Phalcon 5.18 adds native eager loading through `find(['eager' => [...]])`
  and `Criteria::eager()`. PhalconKit models bridge native `setRelated()` data
  into their read-only relationship cache, so native eager loading and the
  existing `findWith()`/`findFirstWith()` APIs can coexist. Do not pass both an
  `eager` parameter and the same graph to `findWith()` in one query.
- Code that enumerates native event listeners must use
  `Phalcon\Events\Manager::getListenerMap()`; the short-lived
  `getEventTypes()` name is not part of the final 5.18 API.
- MariaDB applications that manually stripped quotes from values returned by
  `Mysql::describeColumns()` should remove that workaround; 5.18 normalizes
  string, date, and time defaults itself.

- Replace deprecated `Phalcon\Events\ManagerInterface` and
  `Phalcon\Events\EventInterface` references in application-owned contracts with
  `Phalcon\Contracts\Events\Manager` and `Phalcon\Contracts\Events\Event`.
- Keep native Phalcon setter boundaries honest. If a native method still
  requires a concrete `Phalcon\Events\Manager`, guard or type the value there
  instead of passing only a broader contract.
- Keep mailer config canonical and lower-case, especially
  `MAILER_SMTP_ENCRYPTION=ssl` or `tls`. PhalconKit normalizes common casing,
  but lowercase config keeps app examples and deploy variables unambiguous.
- Validate app config for provider options that become network behavior later,
  such as mailer driver, SMTP encryption, host, port, username, and adapter
  class names.
- If overriding REST/query policy setters or merge helpers, keep signatures
  widened to the current `array|\Phalcon\Support\Collection|null` contracts.
- If using `modelHasColumn()`, keep application PHPDoc aligned with its nullable
  model-name contract. The helper returns `false` for missing or invalid model
  names instead of requiring a strict `class-string`.

## Validation

Run the smallest useful checks before the extension is installed, then run the
runtime checks after installation.

Before installing the new extension:

```shell
composer validate --strict --no-check-publish
git diff --check
```

After installing the new extension:

```shell
composer check-platform-reqs
composer phpcs
composer psalm
composer psalm:taint
composer phpunit
```

For a public release, run the full release gate from
[Quality And Maintenance](quality-and-maintenance.md) and follow
[Release Process](release.md).

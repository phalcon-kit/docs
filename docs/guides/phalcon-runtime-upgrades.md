# Runtime Compatibility

Phalcon Kit documentation follows the maintained Core 4.x line, currently
unreleased on `master`. Earlier package releases are unsupported; references
to them below describe compatibility history. The package’s `composer.json`,
CI workflow, and release notes are the authorities for exact PHP, Phalcon
extension, and development-tool versions.

Use this guide to verify that an application’s runtime matches those declared
requirements without duplicating version numbers in application documentation.

## Phalcon 5.22.0 Upgrade Notes

Core 3.11.1 requires Phalcon `^5.22.0` and matching `phalcon/ide-stubs`
`^5.22.0`. CI installs the checksum-verified official 5.22.0 release built
with Zephir 1.5.0. Update CLI, PHP-FPM, and long-lived workers together before
refreshing Composer dependencies.

The annotations adapter still uses the docblock `Reader` by default. Applications
can opt into PHP attributes by calling `setReader(new
\Phalcon\Annotations\AttributesReader())` on their annotations adapter before
reading or caching class metadata. This does not automatically convert existing
docblocks or Core scaffolding to attributes.
Attribute arguments retain PHP types; numeric docblock defaults such as `0`
are returned as strings, while the corresponding PHP attribute keeps the integer.

- `ReaderInterface` no longer declares static `parseDocBlock()`. Code that
  parses a docblock directly should call `Phalcon\Annotations\Reader::parseDocBlock()`;
  custom readers implement the instance `parse()` contract.
- Router attributes live under `Phalcon\Annotations\Router`; model metadata
  attributes live under `Phalcon\Annotations\Models\MetaData`.
- The annotations metadata strategy accepts `skipOnInsert`, `skipOnUpdate`,
  `allowEmptyString`, and `defaultValue` alongside the existing snake-case
  options and `default`. Existing docblock models remain supported.

See the [upstream release notes](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/v5.22.0).

## Phalcon 5.21.0 Upgrade Notes

Core 3.10.8 introduced the Phalcon `^5.21.0` baseline. Earlier Core releases
redeclare model properties without the native
types now required by Phalcon and fail when a model class loads. Update CLI, PHP-FPM, and long-lived
workers together, then refresh dependencies and run the checks below.

Review these upstream behavior changes before deploying:

- `commit()` and `rollback()` throw
  `Phalcon\Db\Exceptions\NoActiveTransaction` when no transaction is active.
  Pair transaction operations and guard optional error cleanup with
  `isUnderTransaction()` so cleanup does not hide the original exception.
  Failed transaction operations now preserve the nesting level.
- Native `findFirst(['eager' => ['RelationAlias']])` now loads relations.
  Phalcon Kit's `findFirstWith()` remains supported. Review existing queries
  that supplied an `eager` option previously ignored by native `findFirst()`.
- PHQL string literals now resolve escape sequences. Prefer bound parameters
  for user values; check intentional literal backslashes in hand-written PHQL.
- File validators reject missing/non-upload values and unreadable images.
  Declare optional-file behavior explicitly instead of relying on malformed
  input passing validation. Per-field private/reserved IP options are honored.
- Relation resolution, composite foreign keys, cached resultsets, form options,
  Volt compilation, and concurrent stream-directory creation include fixes.

See the [upstream release notes](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/v5.21.0)
for the complete list. The stub patches are rebased on 5.21.0 while retaining
Phalcon Kit's existing model signature and iterable-result annotations.

## Compatibility Has Several Layers

A working installation aligns all of these surfaces:

| Layer | Source of truth | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PHP runtime | `composer.json` | Language features and extension ABI |
| Native Phalcon extension | `ext-phalcon` constraint | Runtime classes and behavior |
| IDE/analyzer stubs | `phalcon/ide-stubs` constraint | Static signatures and completion |
| Application lock file | `composer.lock` | Reproducible dependency graph |
| Container images | Docker build arguments | Production/runtime parity |
| CI setup | Workflow install and cache keys | Proof on a clean environment |

Changing only one layer can produce misleading results—for example, an IDE may
accept a method that the loaded extension does not provide, or CLI PHP may load
a different extension than PHP-FPM.

## Inspect The Declared Requirements

From the application root:

```bash
composer show phalcon-kit/core
composer show phalcon/ide-stubs 2>/dev/null || true
composer check-platform-reqs
```

To inspect the installed native runtime directly:

```bash
php --version
php -r 'echo phpversion("phalcon") ?: "not installed", PHP_EOL;'
php --ri phalcon
```

!!! warning "Check every PHP runtime you actually use"

    CLI, PHP-FPM, queue workers, and Swoole/WebSocket processes can load
    different `php.ini` files. Run the extension check inside each production
    container or process environment instead of assuming they match.

## Install Or Update An Application

Core 4.0 is still unreleased, so there is currently no supported stable release.
An unconstrained install can select an unsupported older release. For isolated
Core 4.0 evaluation, follow the [upgrade guide](upgrading-4.0.md) and explicitly
select the development branch:

```bash
composer require phalcon-kit/core:dev-master
```

Review the dependency and lockfile changes against the application's PHP and
platform extensions. Once a stable Core 4.x release is published, use a suitable
tagged 4.x constraint and commit the application's lockfile.

For a focused update:

```bash
composer update phalcon-kit/core phalcon/ide-stubs --with-dependencies
composer check-platform-reqs
```

Do not use `--ignore-platform-reqs` as a permanent install strategy. A targeted
ignore can help prepare metadata before a native extension is installed, but
the final environment must pass `composer check-platform-reqs` without ignores.

## Upgrade The Core Package Runtime

When maintainers change the supported runtime, keep the work in one reviewable
slice:

1. Update PHP, `ext-phalcon`, and stub constraints in `composer.json`.
2. Update Docker build arguments and base images.
3. Update CI installers, download URLs, and extension cache keys.
4. Review upstream release notes for changed and removed APIs.
5. Search source, tests, examples, and patches for affected symbols.
6. Refresh dependency metadata and run the complete QA gate.
7. Record concrete compatibility changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.

Avoid mixing the runtime bump with unrelated model, schema, or API behavior.
That separation makes failures attributable and makes downstream upgrades easier
to review.

## Review Framework Boundaries

Native runtime changes most often affect these integration points:

- DI container and service-provider contracts;
- events manager and event contract names;
- request, response, cookies, and session behavior;
- model relationships, eager loading, resultsets, and database metadata;
- router and dispatcher method signatures;
- validation, filtering, and message collections;
- debug rendering and error handling;
- PHPDoc/stub signatures used by Psalm, PHPStan, and IDEs.

Search both code and documentation. A compatibility fix is incomplete if the
runtime works but public examples still teach removed APIs.

```bash
rg 'Phalcon\\|ext-phalcon|phalcon/ide-stubs|PHALCON_VERSION' \
  composer.json src tests guides .github Dockerfile*
```

Adjust the paths for the repository. Review every result rather than applying a
blind namespace replacement.

## Audit Deprecated Framework APIs

Treat the matching `phalcon/ide-stubs` package as the machine-readable
deprecation inventory. Search its PHPDoc for `@deprecated`, then map every
deprecated class, interface, method, and constant back to source, tests, public
examples, and reusable skills.

Prefer canonical `Phalcon\Contracts\...` interfaces over legacy implementation
namespace interfaces. Replace dispatcher aliases such as `getParam()`,
`getParams()`, `setParam()`, and `setParams()` with their `Parameter` forms.
Run `PhalconDeprecationTest` after every baseline upgrade so new upstream
deprecations cannot silently enter published source or examples.

Some Phalcon 5.x native override signatures and canonical contracts still name
legacy interfaces. Keep those exact native boundaries until upstream changes
the parent signature; broadening a child signature can claim support the parent
cannot actually accept. The test's narrow allowlist documents these temporary
holds and will fail when a hold moves or a deprecated type is reintroduced
elsewhere.

### Remaining Native Signature Holds In 5.22.0

The deprecation test checks these native parameter types with reflection as
well as checking the source allowlist. Revisit each hold when upstream changes
its signature:

| Legacy interface | Native boundary still using it |
| --- | --- |
| `AdapterInterface` (database) | Model `preSaveRelatedRecords()` / `postSaveRelatedRecords()` |
| `ColumnInterface` (database) | MySQL dialect `getColumnDefinition()` |
| `AdapterInterface` (logger) | Logger `addAdapter()` |
| `FormatterInterface` (logger) | Canonical logger adapter `setFormatter()` |
| `CollectionInterface` (support) | Model `doSave()` |

Use canonical contracts in new independent code. Preserve the holds above in
this patch release: changing a protected parameter to a broader canonical
interface can invalidate downstream overrides that still use the narrower
legacy interface. A wrapper that forwards a canonical-only object to a native
method expecting the legacy interface would also fail at runtime.

## Validate In Increasing Scope

Start with fast checks:

```bash
php -m | rg '^phalcon$'
composer validate --strict --no-check-publish
composer check-platform-reqs
git diff --check
```

Then run package quality gates:

```bash
composer phpcs
composer psalm
composer psalm:taint
composer phpunit
composer skeleton
```

Finally, prove the application paths that static analysis cannot cover:

- bootstrap one HTTP request;
- run migrations against a disposable database;
- execute one representative model relationship query;
- create and update a model with validation enabled;
- run one CLI task;
- boot any long-lived worker or WebSocket process;
- build the production container from a clean cache.

## Diagnose A Mismatch

| Symptom | Likely cause | First check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Composer reports a missing `ext-phalcon` | CLI PHP does not load the extension | `php --ini` and `php --ri phalcon` |
| IDE accepts a method but runtime fails | Stub/runtime versions differ | Compare Composer stubs with `phpversion('phalcon')` |
| Web works but CLI fails | Different PHP binary or INI | `which php`, `php --ini`, FPM config |
| CI recompiles Phalcon every run | Cache key or installed-version check is stale | Workflow extension cache and installer step |
| Container works locally but not in deployment | Different image digest/build argument | Inspect the deployed image metadata |

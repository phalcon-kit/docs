# Developer Guides

Build a complete Phalcon Kit application one workflow at a time. These guides
document the current branch of `phalcon-kit/core`; Composer metadata is the
authority for runtime and dependency requirements. `master` now carries
unreleased Core 4.0 development, the only maintained line. All earlier releases
are unsupported; their matching tags preserve historical documentation. See
[Upgrading To Core 4.0](upgrading-4.0.md) for breaking changes and remaining
release gates. There is currently no supported stable release.

!!! tip "New to Phalcon Kit?"

    Start with **Getting Started** for the Core 4.0 evaluation instructions and
    current skeleton limitations, then follow the **First API** track.

## Core Concepts

Use these guides as the durable reference while building:

| Topic | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| [Architecture](architecture.md) | Where should bootstrap, config, generated code, models, controllers, and tasks live? |
| [Configuration](configuration.md) | How do modules, providers, aliases, events, identity, and permissions fit together? |
| [Database And Scaffolding](database-scaffolding.md) | Which files are generated, which files are app-owned, and how do schema changes flow into code? |
| [Models And Eager Loading](models-and-eager-loading.md) | How do relationships, nested saves, eager loading, behaviors, snapshots, and cache invalidation work? |
| [REST APIs](rest-api.md) | How are fields, filters, joins, counts, transformers, and response envelopes configured? |
| [Identity And Permissions](identity-and-permissions.md) | How are feature access, roles, attributes, behaviors, and row-level policy enforced? |

## Examples And Answers

- [Developer Cookbook](cookbook.md) contains focused copy-and-adapt recipes for
  common application tasks.
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) starts from symptoms such as boot
  failures, missing services, routing errors, migration drift, and unexpected
  REST output.
- [API Reference](https://phalcon-kit.github.io/docs/api/) is generated from the
  current source and is useful when you know the class or method name.

## Latest-Version Policy

This documentation is intentionally rolling:

- it follows the maintained Core 4.x line, currently unreleased on `master`;
- it does not maintain parallel versioned sites;
- installation examples distinguish development previews from stable releases;
- exact versions belong in Composer metadata, release notes, and compatibility
  investigations where the number itself matters.

Phalcon Kit extends Phalcon instead of replacing it. Use the
[latest Phalcon documentation](https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/){:target="_blank"}
for native framework behavior. Phalcon Kit is independently maintained and is
not affiliated with or endorsed by the official Phalcon project.

## AI-Assisted Development

Read [AI-Assisted Development](https://github.com/phalcon-kit/core/blob/master/AI.md) for bundled skill paths, safe usage,
and coverage notes. Human-facing guides explain the concepts; agent references
under `resources/skills/` add stricter operational instructions. Both surfaces
should describe the same public conventions.

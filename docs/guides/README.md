# Guides

These guides are for developers who want to build Phalcon applications faster
with Phalcon Kit. Start with the task you are trying to complete.

## I Want To Build A REST API

1. [Build Your First REST Resource](first-rest-resource.md): build a resource
   from schema to controller, permissions, and request/response examples.
2. [REST APIs](rest-api.md): learn the REST controller policy methods.
3. [Models And Eager Loading](models-and-eager-loading.md): load relation graphs
   without lazy-loading loops.
4. [Identity And Permissions](identity-and-permissions.md): add role and
   row-level access.

## I Want To Start Or Integrate A Project

1. [Getting Started](getting-started.md): install, bootstrap, run locally.
2. [Configuration](configuration.md): configure modules, providers, aliases, and
   permissions.
3. [Architecture](architecture.md): understand where app code, generated code,
   modules, and tasks belong.

## I Want To Generate Models From A Database

1. [Database And Scaffolding](database-scaffolding.md): run migrations and
   scaffold generated model layers.
2. [Models And Eager Loading](models-and-eager-loading.md): add concrete model
   behavior and relationship loading.
3. [Build Your First REST Resource](first-rest-resource.md): connect generated
   models to a REST controller.

## I Want To Deploy Or Maintain The Package

1. [Web Server And WebSocket](web-server-and-websocket.md): PHP-FPM, web roots,
   and WebSocket worker proxying.
2. [Quality And Maintenance](quality-and-maintenance.md): local QA commands and
   CI expectations.
3. [Phalcon Runtime Upgrades](phalcon-runtime-upgrades.md): update the native
   extension, Composer platform requirement, IDE stubs, Docker images, and CI
   pins together.
4. [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/phalcon-kit/core/blob/3.9.0/ROADMAP.md): release blocks, priorities, retired
   GitHub Project items, and maintainer planning rules.
5. [Testing Strategy](testing-roadmap.md): phased unit, component,
   integration, model, eager-loading, and REST API coverage approach.
6. [To Be Discussed](to-be-discussed.md): open maintainer design questions that
   need a concrete use case before behavior changes.
7. [Release Process](release.md): release checklist and package-history notes.

## I Am Using zemit-cms/core

Read [Migration From zemit-cms/core](migration-from-zemit.md) before changing
package constraints. The short version: new projects use `phalcon-kit/core`;
older projects should stay pinned until the migration can be tested.

If the application also uses old 0.x RESTful controllers, read
[Migrate RESTful 0.x Resources To 1.x](migration-restful-0x-to-1x.md) for the
controller, scaffolding, eager-loading, permission, and custom-action migration.

## Official Phalcon Docs

Phalcon Kit extends Phalcon instead of replacing it. Use the official Phalcon
docs for native framework behavior and these guides for PhalconKit conventions.
Phalcon Kit is independently maintained and is not affiliated with, endorsed by,
or sponsored by the official Phalcon PHP Framework project.

- Phalcon framework: https://phalcon.io

## Agent References

Read [AI-Assisted Development](https://github.com/phalcon-kit/core/blob/3.9.0/AI.md) for the bundled skill paths, usage
examples, safety defaults, and coverage notes.

Agent-specific instructions live under `resources/skills/`. Human readers
should start here in `guides/`; agents can use the skills for stricter coding
rules and deeper implementation conventions. The human docs and skill
references should stay aligned on the same public concepts: database-first
scaffolding, REST controllers, eager loading, transformers, identity,
permissions, CLI/WebSocket workflows, providers, and generated-file boundaries.

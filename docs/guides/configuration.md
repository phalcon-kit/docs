# Configuration

Phalcon Kit applications are configured through app-owned config classes. Keep
secrets in environment files and keep application structure in code:

- modules
- providers
- router defaults
- model aliases
- permissions and roles
- locale defaults
- service integrations

Think of configuration in three layers:

| Layer | Keep here | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package defaults | Reusable framework behavior | default providers and router targets |
| App config | Reviewable application structure and policy | modules, aliases, permissions |
| Environment | Machine-specific values and secrets | database host, credentials, feature toggles |

App config should merge with package defaults intentionally. Environment values
should provide data to config, not replace the config structure.

- Routing: https://docs.phalcon.io/latest/routing/

## Environment

Example `.env` values:

```ini
APP_NAME="My App"

DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1
DATABASE_DBNAME=app
DATABASE_USERNAME=app
DATABASE_PASSWORD=app
```

Keep secrets and machine-specific paths in environment files. Keep module
registration, providers, aliases, and policy in config classes so they can be
reviewed and versioned.

## App Config

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use PhalconKit\Support\Env;

final class Config extends \PhalconKit\Bootstrap\Config
{
    public function __construct(array $data = [], bool $insensitive = false)
    {
        $data = $this->internalMergeAppend([
            'app' => [
                'name' => Env::get('APP_NAME', 'My App'),
            ],
            'modules' => [
                \PhalconKit\Mvc\Module::NAME_API => [
                    'className' => \App\Modules\Api\Module::class,
                    'path' => APP_PATH . 'Modules/Api/Module.php',
                ],
            ],
        ], $data);

        parent::__construct($data, $insensitive);
    }
}
```

Use `internalMergeAppend()` when the app wants to keep Phalcon Kit defaults and
append or override only the app-owned parts.

## Modules

Modules define runtime boundaries. Common module names are:

- `frontend`
- `admin`
- `api`
- `oauth2`
- `cli`
- `ws`

Register app modules explicitly:

```php
'modules' => [
    \PhalconKit\Mvc\Module::NAME_API => [
        'className' => \App\Modules\Api\Module::class,
        'path' => APP_PATH . 'Modules/Api/Module.php',
    ],
],
```

## HTTP Exception Route

Expected MVC request failures raised as
`PhalconKit\Exception\HttpException` use the dedicated
`router.httpException` target. Its defaults keep the current module context and
dispatch to `errorAction()`:

```php
'router' => [
    'httpException' => [
        'namespace' => Env::get('ROUTER_HTTP_EXCEPTION_NAMESPACE'),
        'module' => Env::get('ROUTER_HTTP_EXCEPTION_MODULE'),
        'controller' => Env::get('ROUTER_HTTP_EXCEPTION_CONTROLLER', 'error'),
        'action' => Env::get('ROUTER_HTTP_EXCEPTION_ACTION', 'error'),
    ],
],
```

Applications may override this route and controller to adapt their response
envelope. The dispatcher still owns status validation: only HttpException codes
from 400 through 599 are preserved, and invalid codes become HTTP 500. Generic
exceptions never derive transport status from their numeric exception code;
production failures use `router.fatal`, while debug mode rethrows them.

## Provider Overrides

Provider overrides are config-first. Replace a core provider by keeping the
core provider class as the key. Register new app services with the app provider
as both key and value.

```php
'providers' => [
    \PhalconKit\Provider\Identity\ServiceProvider::class =>
        \App\Provider\Identity\ServiceProvider::class,

    \App\Provider\Firebase\ServiceProvider::class =>
        \App\Provider\Firebase\ServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Common provider categories include database, cache, session, identity, ACL,
router, request/response, logger/loggers, mailer, Redis, Swoole, OpenAI, OAuth,
filesystem, translation, view, Volt, URL, and helpers.

Use app providers when a service needs app configuration, app credentials, or a
different implementation. Avoid replacing a core provider just to change one
runtime option when config already supports it.

Phalcon 5.20.3 and newer let storage-backed cache adapters restrict PHP object
deserialization with `cache.default.allowedClasses`. PhalconKit defaults this
to `true` for compatibility with model and application object caches. Set
`CACHE_ALLOWED_CLASSES=false` when the cache stores only scalars and arrays, or
set an explicit class-name list in application config when cached objects are
required. Clear incompatible cache entries when tightening the policy.

For password hashing, keep PhalconKit's Argon2id default or use bcrypt.
Phalcon 5.20.3 marks `CRYPT_MD5`, `CRYPT_SHA256`, and `CRYPT_SHA512` as weak
legacy algorithms scheduled for removal in a future major release. Applications
with legacy hashes should verify them at login and immediately rehash the
password with Argon2id or bcrypt.

## Event Listeners

Use `eventsManager.listeners` for app-owned listeners that should attach to the
shared Phalcon events manager during bootstrap:

```php
'eventsManager' => [
    'listeners' => [
        'dispatch' => [
            [
                'class' => \App\Listeners\SecurityHeaders::class,
                'priority' => 200,
            ],
            [
                'service' => 'auditDispatchListener',
                'priority' => 100,
            ],
        ],
        'db' => [
            \App\Listeners\QueryCorrelation::class,
        ],
    ],
],
```

Listeners are grouped by Phalcon event type, such as `dispatch`, `db`, `model`,
or `view`. A listener can be a class name, a DI service name, or an array with
`class` or `service`. Array definitions also support `priority`, `arguments`,
and `enabled => false`.

The bootstrap attaches these listeners after providers are registered and before
modules/router setup. Core providers keep their existing built-in listener
wiring; this config is for application listeners that should participate in the
same shared event manager without replacing providers.

## Stateless Identity

API-only applications can keep Phalcon Kit's normal `session` service available
while making identity itself stateless:

```php
'identity' => [
    'stateless' => true,
],
```

or through the environment:

```ini
IDENTITY_STATELESS=true
```

Stateless identity stores the small identity payload, such as `userId` and
`asUserId`, directly in the JWT claim instead of PHP session storage. The
session provider still registers and starts the configured Phalcon session
manager, so flash messages, OAuth2 state, locale persistence, and other session
consumers keep their normal behavior.

Do not combine stateless identity with `identity.sessionFallback`; fallback
storage is ignored when `identity.stateless` is enabled. Clients must replace
their JWT after login, logout, OAuth2 login, impersonation, and refresh
responses that include new token values. Old JWTs are not server-revoked unless
the application adds its own revocation strategy.

### App Service Provider Example

Use a provider when the service belongs in the DI container and is shared by
controllers, tasks, models, or other services.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Provider\Report;

use App\Service\ReportExporter;
use PhalconKit\Di\DiInterface;
use PhalconKit\Provider\AbstractServiceProvider;

final class ServiceProvider extends AbstractServiceProvider
{
    protected string $serviceName = 'reportExporter';

    #[\Override]
    public function register(DiInterface $di): void
    {
        $di->setShared($this->getName(), function () use ($di) {
            return new ReportExporter(
                $di->getTyped('db', \Phalcon\Contracts\Db\Adapter\Adapter::class),
                $di->getTyped('logger', \Phalcon\Contracts\Logger\Logger::class)
            );
        });
    }
}
```

### Phalcon Kit DI Boundary

Applications that use `PhalconKit\Bootstrap` normally do not need to change
anything: bootstrap creates a Phalcon Kit DI container before registering config,
providers, modules, and services.

Custom bootstraps and tests that pass their own container into
`Bootstrap::setDI()` must pass `PhalconKit\Di\DiInterface`, such as
`PhalconKit\Di\Di`, `PhalconKit\Di\FactoryDefault`, or
`PhalconKit\Di\FactoryDefault\Cli`. Native `Phalcon\Di\Di` is no longer the
provider/bootstrap boundary because it does not expose Phalcon Kit's typed
helpers.

Use the typed helpers when the service contract is known:

```php
$config = $di->getConfig();
$view = $di->getTyped('view', \Phalcon\Mvc\ViewInterface::class);
```

Native Phalcon DI signatures may still appear where Phalcon Kit extends native
Phalcon interfaces or classes. App-owned providers should use
`PhalconKit\Di\DiInterface`.

Register it in app config:

```php
'providers' => [
    \App\Provider\Report\ServiceProvider::class =>
        \App\Provider\Report\ServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Then use it from an injectable class:

```php
$this->reportExporter->exportProject($projectId);
```

## Model Aliases

Applications can map framework model roles to app model classes. This keeps
identity, permissions, and scaffolded resources decoupled from a fixed model
namespace.

```php
'models' => [
    'user' => \App\Models\User::class,
    'role' => \App\Models\Role::class,
    'workspace' => \App\Models\Workspace::class,
],
```

## Permissions

Permission config maps features to components, component methods, optional
query behaviors, and roles.

```php
'permissions' => [
    'features' => [
        'manageLocation' => [
            'components' => [
                \App\Modules\Api\Controllers\LocationController::class => ['*'],
                \App\Models\Location::class => ['*'],
            ],
        ],
    ],
    'roles' => [
        'admin' => [
            'features' => ['manageLocation'],
        ],
    ],
],
```

The identity/security system can enforce permissions across controllers,
actions, models, methods, CLI tasks, and WebSocket tasks.

Controller/action attributes are enabled by default and are merged into the same
permission graph at runtime. Disable attribute scanning for config-only
applications that want to avoid controller reflection. The default bootstrap
config reads `ACL_ATTRIBUTES`:

```php
'acl' => [
    'attributes' => Env::get('ACL_ATTRIBUTES', true),
],
```

For row-level controller conditions and role inheritance, read
[Identity And Permissions](identity-and-permissions.md).

## Validate Configuration Changes

Configuration failures should surface during bootstrap, before a request reaches
business code. After changing modules, providers, aliases, or permissions:

```shell
composer validate --strict --no-check-publish
composer phpunit
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public public/index.php
```

Then exercise one route that resolves each changed service or policy. For a new
provider, add a focused test that builds the container and asserts the service
implements its intended contract.

Continue with [Developer Cookbook](cookbook.md) for provider and endpoint
recipes, or [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) when bootstrap cannot resolve
the expected configuration.

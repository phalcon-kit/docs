# Upgrading To Core 4.0

This guide covers the breaking changes in **Core 4.0.0** and the checks required
when adopting it in an application. PHP 8.5 and Phalcon 5.22 remain the runtime
baseline.

Only Core 4.x is maintained. All earlier versions, including `zemit-cms/core`,
are end of life and receive no support, bug fixes, security fixes, or backports.
Older tags remain available for reproducible installs during migration; see
the [security policy](https://github.com/phalcon-kit/core/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

Core 4.0 focuses on reusable Phalcon extensions and common application features.
Application schemas belong to the applications that use them. This change
retires the old spreadsheet/catalog application and CMS runtime while keeping
the existing provider, model-mapping, controller, and module extension patterns.

## What Stays

- Bootstrap, configuration, providers, MVC/CLI/WebSocket modules, and helpers.
- REST controllers, query/filter/save rules, response transformers, model
  behaviors, eager loading, nested relationship writes, and scaffolding.
- Identity, login/registration/reset hooks, sessions, impersonation, permissions,
  roles/groups/types, email/templates, files, audit, and settings.
- Locale, translation adapters, validation helpers, and ordinary database models.
- Generic database maintenance commands and the existing REST compatibility
  aliases. Migrate callers of deprecated routes separately with response tests.

The remaining prepared models (`Backup`, `Job`/`JobScheduler`, `Profile`,
`FileRelation`, and feature/association models) stay in this first scope. Some
are referenced by retained services or model relationships; absence of an
application import alone is insufficient evidence for removing them.

Core remains one package. No new repository abstraction or optional legacy
package is introduced by this change.

See [Retained Feature Contracts](feature-contracts.md) for model replacement,
required services/tables, and workflows owned by the application.

## Removed Model Inventory

All names in this table are under `PhalconKit\Models\`. For each name, the
concrete class, `Abstracts\{Name}Abstract`,
`Abstracts\Interfaces\{Name}AbstractInterface`, and
`Interfaces\{Name}Interface` are removed together.

| Retired area | Model families |
| --- | --- |
| Dynamic catalog | `Workspace`, `WorkspaceLang`, `Table`, `Column`, `Record`, `Data`, `Validator` |
| CMS | `Site`, `SiteLang`, `Page`, `Post`, `PostCategory`, `Category`, `Menu`, `Meta` |
| Database-backed language/translation records | `Lang`, `Translate` |
| Site-owned flags | `Flag` |

`Flag` belongs to the retired Site model graph. The separate `Feature` model
and feature permissions remain. `Models\Validator` was a catalog table model;
`PhalconKit\Filter\Validation` and its validators remain.

An application's `App\Models\Record`, `Data`, `Table`, or `Workspace` is not
removed. Inspect its parent, implemented interfaces, relations, and configuration
before deciding whether it depends on a retired Core contract. Ordinary models
can continue extending `PhalconKit\Mvc\Model` or
`PhalconKit\Models\AbstractModel` through application-owned generated abstracts.

## Removed Runtime Surface

| Surface | Exact removal | Application action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API controllers in `PhalconKit\Modules\Api\Controllers` | `CategoryController`, `ColumnController`, `DataController`, `FlagController`, `LangController`, `MenuController`, `MetaController`, `PageController`, `PostController`, `RecordController`, `TableController`, `TranslateController`, `WorkspaceController`, plus the placeholder `FieldController`, `TranslateFieldController`, `TranslateTableController` | Remove obsolete routes/permissions, or implement an app-owned resource using the generic API controller. |
| Model implementation | `PhalconKit\Mvc\Model\Dynamic` | Use app-owned models with stable class/source metadata. There is no drop-in dynamic-source replacement. |
| Record transformer | `PhalconKit\Modules\Api\Transformers\RecordTransformer` | Use an application transformer for the application's record model. The generic transformer infrastructure remains. |
| Database provider | `PhalconKit\Provider\DatabaseDynamic\ServiceProvider`, service `dbd`, `database.drivers.dynamic`, `PROVIDER_DATABASE_DYNAMIC`, and `DATABASE_DYNAMIC_*` defaults | Remove unused configuration. If a second database is needed, register an application provider explicitly. Primary `db` and read-only `dbr` remain. |
| Permission presets in `PhalconKit\Bootstrap\Permissions` | `ColumnConfig`, `DynamicConfig`, `RecordConfig`, `TableConfig`, `WorkspaceConfig` | Remove these imports and ACL entries; define policies for app-owned resources. `TemplateConfig` remains. |
| Catalog fixture generator | `PhalconKit\Modules\Cli\Tasks\FakerTask` and `bin/database-faker.sh` | Remove task/permission references and scheduled invocations. Use application fixtures or explicit deployment seed rows. The generic Faker provider remains. |
| Enums in `PhalconKit\Models\Enums` | `ColumnType`, `WorkspaceStatus`, `SiteStatus`, `ValidatorType`, `TranslateTableTable` | Own any still-needed domain enums in the application. |
| Typed registry helpers | `getFlag()`, `getLang()`, `getTranslate()`, `getWorkspace()`, `getWorkspaceLang()`, `getPage()`, `getPost()`, `getTable()`, and their `get{Name}Class()` counterparts | Remove obsolete calls. `models` mappings and generic `getInstance()`/`getClassMap()` continue to support application-owned classes. |
| Default model mappings | Entries and `MODEL_*` defaults for those eight typed registry families | Remove overrides targeting the retired classes. Retained model mappings keep their current contracts. |

The dependency review includes retained models' relationship targets, through
models, service/config references, and application inheritance. Tests initialize
all retained Core models and resolve their relationship classes without opening
a database. This verifies the runtime class graph, not the availability of any
application's database tables.

## Explicit Database Maintenance

`database drop`, `truncate`, `fix-engine`, `insert`, `optimize`, `analyze`, and
`reset` remain available. Core no longer supplies table lists, role/language
seeds, or a development account. With no instructions, these commands perform
no database queries. `main` still runs engine changes, optimization, and analysis;
`reset` still truncates before inserting.

Put instructions in the application configuration, using its own table and
model names. For example:

```php
'deployment' => [
    'drop' => [],
    'truncate' => [],
    'engine' => ['app_lookup' => 'InnoDB'],
    'optimize' => ['app_lookup'],
    'analyze' => ['app_lookup'],
    'insert' => [
        \App\Models\Lookup::class => [
            ['key' => 'active', 'label' => 'Active'],
        ],
    ],
],
```

Each configured key replaces the matching task property in full. Omitted keys
preserve an application subclass's defaults, including properties assigned
before `parent::initialize()`. An explicit empty array disables that operation.
The six arrays may also be set directly on an application `DatabaseTask`.
`Bootstrap\Deployment` remains available as a config container with empty defaults.

These are trusted maintainer instructions, not request input. `drop` and
`truncate` destroy data, engine names must be trusted, and inserts are ordinary
model saves with their validation/events. Seeds use the concrete class key
exactly as supplied; Core-to-app model mappings are not applied here. The task
grants the CLI role access to the configured seed models. Repeated inserts are
not automatically idempotent, and reset is not an atomic database transaction.

Review existing seed records before copying them. Supply account credentials
explicitly through the application's account-creation flow; do not recreate the
old default development account or assume that seed insertion generates a
secure password.

## Existing Data And Migration History

No removal in this branch runs a migration, drops a table, or deletes data.
Keep application-owned migration history and existing schemas intact while
upgrading PHP code. Deleting unused database tables is a separate application
migration with its own data review and rollback plan.

The package now ships `resources/migrations/4.0.0/` for **fresh databases**,
with only the 29 retained Core tables. The old packaged `1.0.0/` directory is
removed; historical tags still contain it. Do not remove or rename migrations
already owned/applied by an application.

The baseline uses InnoDB, connection-local foreign keys, Unicode text defaults,
case-sensitive credential/token comparisons, larger OAuth token storage, and
64-character audit/file relation identifiers. It refuses existing tables/history
and never drops retired tables. Review these changes against actual application
data and introduce separate, explicit upgrade migrations where appropriate.

See [Database Migrations](database-migrations.md) for the fresh installation and
reusable SQL helper. Retained models still require their tables; the baseline
contains no accounts, roles, or other seed records.

## Application Upgrade Checks

1. Keep the application's existing lockfile and a suitable tagged-version
   constraint while preparing an isolated upgrade checkout. `dev-master` now
   follows ongoing development; use `^4.0` for the supported stable line. The old
   `0.4.x`, `1.0.x`, and temporary `4.x` branches have been retired. Applications
   using branch constraints must select an appropriate tagged release or opt
   into testing `dev-master` deliberately.
2. Search imports, parent classes, interfaces, DI registrations, model mappings,
   permission config, routes, CLI schedules, and seed code for the exact retired
   namespaces above. Remove unused imports and permission-only references too.
3. Preserve app-owned schemas and adapt any actual Core-domain dependencies.
   Applications that still need the retired runtime must own the equivalent
   feature before upgrading. Remaining on 3.x means using an unsupported release
   without security fixes or backports. No compatibility shim is provided.
4. Supply explicit database-maintenance instructions. Verify app overrides,
   seed models, and empty defaults with disposable data.
5. Test authentication and reset delivery, authorization, model substitution,
   REST response shapes, nested saves, eager loading, audit/files, and any CLI or
   WebSocket tasks the application uses. Class-loading smoke tests do not prove
   those flows work.

## Release Validation And Application Adoption

Core 4.0 validation includes the lowest/highest dependency CI matrix, native
MySQL baseline and transaction tests, public Composer installs, regenerated API
reference, and isolated application acceptance suites. Consumer fixtures cover
model substitution and persistence, tenant/permission rules, API compatibility,
identity/reset/session behavior, notifications, and application migrations.

These fixtures use disposable schemas and synthetic data. They do not certify
an application's production data conversion, browser/mobile SSO, or external
provider delivery. Verify those workflows in the application's rollout process,
with its own migration review and recovery plan. The fresh Core baseline must
never run over an existing application schema.

Model substitution follows the boundaries in [Retained Feature Contracts](feature-contracts.md):
configured resolvers do not rewrite direct class references or generated
relationships. Preserve application overrides and public REST aliases until
their callers have been migrated and tested.

Only Core 4.x is maintained. `master` is the sole long-lived branch; signed tags
identify releases. See the [release process](release.md) for distribution checks
and the [security policy](https://github.com/phalcon-kit/core/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for the support boundary.

# To Be Discussed

This file tracks design questions that are worth revisiting, but should not
change public behavior until there is a concrete application need, migration
plan, and test coverage.

Actionable release blocks live in the [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/phalcon-kit/core/blob/3.9.0/ROADMAP.md). Promote
an item there only after the expected behavior, compatibility risk, and
validation plan are concrete.

## Reviewed Inline Follow-Ups

Status: Reviewed; selected items remain open.

Area: framework internals, public API design, test coverage

Context:

- On 2026-05-23, every inline follow-up marker outside `vendor/` and generated
  API docs was reviewed.
- Vague source/test comments were replaced with current-behavior comments or
  removed when they were stale.
- The items below are the ones that still have real design value. They should
  not change public behavior until the desired API shape, migration risk, and
  test coverage are clear.

Current stance:

- Keep source comments focused on known limitations and current behavior; do
  not use inline comments as a second backlog.
- Do not implement these as drive-by fixes. Most touch public framework
  contracts or long-standing compatibility behavior.
- Prefer opt-in behavior, compatibility notes, and regression tests before
  changing existing defaults.

Keep for discussion:

- Identity password reset notifications:
  `src/Identity/Manager.php`.
  Decide whether reset-token and reset-completed messages belong in events, a
  notifier service, or app-owned callbacks. Any design must preserve the current
  anti-user-enumeration response behavior.
- Impersonation authorization:
  `src/Identity/Traits/Impersonation.php`.
  Replace the hard-coded `admin`/`dev` role gate only after a config-backed
  impersonation permission contract exists, including audit/session behavior for
  "login as" flows.
- Identity role matching flag naming:
  `src/Identity/Traits/Role.php`,
  `src/Identity/Traits/Acl.php`.
  The legacy `$or` parameter name is confusing because current behavior treats
  `false` as any-match and `true` as all-match at the current nesting level.
  Documentation now states the real behavior, but a future API could add clearer
  names such as `hasAnyRole()`, `hasAllRoles()`, or an explicit match-mode
  value while keeping the existing methods for compatibility.
- Tag factory and legacy tag service split:
  `src/Provider/Assets/ServiceProvider.php`,
  `tests/Unit/Html/TagFactoryTest.php`.
  The assets manager needs a native-style `TagFactory`, while the public `tag`
  service exposes PhalconKit's static helper facade. A cleanup would likely need
  separate service names or a compatibility bridge.
- Database logger correlation context:
  `src/Db/Events/Logger.php`.
  Query logs currently include the effective user and impersonated user IDs.
  Decide whether they should also include session, request, trace, or
  correlation IDs. Any addition needs a stable service contract that works for
  MVC, CLI, WebSocket, and stateless JWT identity contexts.
- CLI router interface compatibility:
  `src/Cli/Router.php`, `tests/Unit/Cli/RouterTest.php`,
  `tests/Unit/Cli/ModuleTest.php`, `tests/Unit/Ws/ModuleTest.php`.
  `Phalcon\Cli\RouterInterface` exists in the current runtime, but
  `Phalcon\Cli\Router` is still not an instance of it because native return
  signatures such as `setDefaultAction()` and `getRouteById()` do not match the
  interface. Keep framework code typed against `PhalconKit\Router\RouterInterface`
  unless upstream Phalcon changes the native implementation.
- Model setup defaults:
  `src/Mvc/Model.php`.
  Revisit `notNullValidations => false` only after generated-model validation,
  database-nullability assumptions, and application migration risk are tested.
- Dynamic model metadata:
  `src/Mvc/Model/Dynamic.php`.
  Replace APCu metadata key deletion with a metadata strategy or adapter wrapper
  only if it handles dynamic sources without changing normal model caching.
- Dynamic record model identity:
  `src/Modules/Api/Controllers/RecordController.php`.
  The controller now uses `Dynamic::createInstance()` instead of runtime
  `eval()`-generated subclasses. Revisit only if a real app needs distinct
  model class names per dynamic source for metadata, events, or policy hooks.
- Relationship assignment:
  `src/Mvc/Model/Traits/Relationship.php`,
  `tests/Unit/Mvc/Model/ModelTest.php`.
  Opt-in strict relation assignment now covers non-whitelisted aliases, unknown
  complex relation payloads, malformed relation values, and nested relation
  assignment. Remaining design work: a clearer replacement for boolean
  keep-missing sentinels, explicit rules for sparse payloads that reactivate
  or update existing relation rows, and future-major defaults for direct
  relationship ownership enforcement, unowned child adoption, and direct
  soft-delete auto-restore.
- Controller behavior responses and merge semantics:
  `src/Mvc/Controller/Traits/Behavior.php`.
  Define whether controller behaviors should collect multiple event responses
  and whether legacy feature/role permission merges should move from native
  recursive merging to the attribute resolver's de-duplicating merge helper.
- `findIn*` model helpers:
  `src/Mvc/Model/Traits/FindIn.php`.
  Expand beyond `findInById()` only after field validation, bind-type
  inference, and method naming rules are defined.
- Soft delete event state:
  `src/Mvc/Model/Traits/SoftDelete.php`.
  Decide whether model setup options should expose ORM event state instead of
  reading the native INI flag inside the trait.
- Static eager-loading magic:
  `src/Mvc/Model/Traits/EagerLoad.php`.
  Keep `__callStatic()` for compatibility unless moving to Phalcon
  `missingMethods()` is proven to intercept the same public method names.
- Eager-loading option propagation:
  `src/Mvc/Model/EagerLoading/Loader.php`,
  `src/Mvc/Model/EagerLoading/EagerLoad.php`.
  Loader options are captured but not passed into relation loading yet. Define
  explicit options for soft-delete visibility, intentional duplicate-row
  preservation, and per-relation constraints before changing the current load
  contract.
- Model cache invalidation:
  `src/Mvc/Model/Traits/Cache.php`.
  The current coarse flush predicate now invalidates on creates, deletes,
  restores, reorders, and changed snapshots while skipping unchanged snapshot
  saves. The minimum granular invalidation contract is documented in
  [Models And Eager Loading](models-and-eager-loading.md#future-granular-cache-policy).
  Keep targeted deletion parked until a real application needs key
  registration, reverse indexes, relation invalidation, and pre-warming beyond
  the shared `modelsCache->clear()` fallback.
- Lifecycle query ownership:
  `src/Mvc/Model/Traits/LifeCycle.php`.
  Moving lifecycle helpers into a model manager would be cleaner, but requires a
  migration plan for static CLI retention task calls.
- Dynamic join filtering:
  `src/Mvc/Controller/Traits/Query/DynamicJoins.php`,
  `src/Mvc/Controller/Traits/Query/Conditions/FilterSemantics.php`.
  Dynamic joins already support request-driven relationship joins for filters.
  Further filter hoisting and join-existence validation could improve
  performance or safety, but they need tests for aliases, permission-scoped
  joins, and user-supplied filter fields.
- REST query save initialization hooks:
  `src/Mvc/Controller/Traits/Query.php`,
  `src/Mvc/Controller/Traits/Query/Fields.php`,
  `src/Mvc/Controller/Traits/Query/Save.php`.
  Save-field initialization now runs through `initializeFields()`. Add dedicated
  `rest:before/afterInitializeSave` hooks only if applications need to mutate
  save-specific query state independently from filter/map/search/expose fields.
- Aggregate WHERE/HAVING promotion:
  `src/Mvc/Controller/Traits/Query.php`.
  Automatically moving conditions containing aggregate functions from `where`
  to `having` is disabled. A future implementation needs parser-aware behavior
  or strict tests so normal fields containing function-like text are not moved
  incorrectly.
- Scaffolded API controller generation:
  `src/Modules/Cli/Tasks/ScaffoldTask.php`.
  Controller generation was previously sketched but is not active. Decide
  whether scaffolding should own concrete API controllers, or whether generated
  model abstracts/interfaces should remain the only core-owned scaffold output.
- Faker task table scope:
  `src/Modules/Cli/Tasks/FakerTask.php`.
  The current task generates data for the first non-deleted table. Generating
  all dynamic tables needs explicit limits, table filtering, and safety rules
  before it can be enabled.
- Eager loading limitations:
  `src/Mvc/Model/EagerLoading/Loader.php`,
  `src/Mvc/Model/EagerLoading/EagerLoad.php`.
  Composite relation keys, multiple local/reference fields, through-relation
  soft-delete visibility, optional grouping, and loader options need a coherent
  API instead of isolated condition edits.
- Binary UUID lifecycle:
  `src/Mvc/Model/Traits/Uuid.php`.
  Binary UUID create support exists, but fetch-time conversion and native
  database UUID round-tripping need a tested API before adding transform hooks
  for existing rows.
- Locale model magic:
  `src/Mvc/Model/Interfaces/LocaleInterface.php`.
  Add `__isset()`/`__unset()` only after translated-property presence semantics
  are defined.
- Dispatcher listeners:
  `src/Mvc/Dispatcher/Module.php`, `src/Mvc/Dispatcher/Rest.php`,
  `src/Mvc/Dispatcher/Camelize.php`.
  Standardize module namespace rewriting, decide whether the pass-through REST
  dispatcher listener should gain supported behavior or be removed, and decide
  whether Camelize should be an opt-in listener, a default listener, or removed
  from the public dispatcher surface.
- Translation keys containing the delimiter inside nested arrays:
  `tests/Unit/Translate/TranslateTest.php`,
  `src/Translate/Adapter/NestedNativeArray.php`.
  Supporting this would require a longest-match lookup strategy that preserves
  the existing flat-key precedence.
- Environment loader invalid types:
  `tests/Unit/Support/EnvTest.php`, `src/Support/Env.php`.
  Current behavior normalizes invalid types to `Mutable`; stricter exceptions
  would be a behavior change and should be explicit.
- ClamAV positive scan fixture:
  `tests/Unit/Provider/ClamavTest.php`.
  Add EICAR coverage only with a CI-safe fixture/download strategy that does
  not trigger repository, package, or local antivirus scanners unexpectedly.
- Faker seed modes:
  `src/Modules/Cli/Tasks/FakerTask.php`.
  The built-in faker task currently inserts generated structure and curated
  real-data fixtures. Re-enable synthetic record insertion only behind an
  explicit CLI flag or config option so test/demo data volume, randomness, and
  repeatability are predictable.
- TypeScript scaffold defaults:
  `src/Modules/Cli/Tasks/TsScaffoldTask.php`.
  Default values and related default objects are helper methods but are not
  emitted into generated TypeScript yet. Decide whether generated clients
  should preserve database defaults, expose DTO defaults, or leave defaults to
  server-side model validation.
- Scaffold output encoding:
  `src/Modules/Cli/Tasks/ScaffoldTask.php`.
  Generated PHP files are written as UTF-8 without a BOM. Add a BOM option only
  if a supported downstream editor or runtime requires it, because BOM output
  can affect headers and generated-file diffs.

Closed or clarified during review:

- Blank comments in flash, exposer, and dispatcher code were removed or
  replaced with explicit current-behavior comments.
- Commented translation coverage was restored with the real `Phalcon Kit`
  message key; delimiter-containing nested translation keys remain an open
  design question above.
- Commented ClamAV file-positive coverage was removed because stream-based
  EICAR coverage already asserts positive detection without storing an EICAR
  fixture in the repository.
- Commented debug dumps, obsolete fallback throws, and runtime `eval()` sketch
  code were removed from source. Current behavior is now either executable code
  or tracked in this discussion guide.
- REST query initialization now carries the configured aggregate `column`
  collection into prepared find options instead of leaving the live code
  commented out.
- Audit snapshot filtering was promoted to the project roadmap because the
  desired behavior is concrete and testable.
- JSON escaping of `null` remains `null` as a string because the helper is used
  for `JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(...))` payloads.
- Event cancellation behavior is now asserted directly instead of questioned in
  a comment.
- The disabled multibyte sprintf encoding test was removed because the example
  used Chinese text with an encoding that cannot represent it.
- Stale commented-out examples in model relationship tests, dispatcher
  security, eager loading, export helpers, relationship assignment, and
  scaffolding were either removed or captured above as explicit design
  questions.

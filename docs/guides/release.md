# Release Process

Use this checklist when preparing a public release.

## Version Policy

Phalcon Kit follows SemVer for tagged public releases. Keep unreleased work
under the current `Unreleased` heading in `CHANGELOG.md` until the tag is cut.

Core and the App skeleton start the 4.x line together at **4.0.0**. App
intentionally skips 3.x to align its major version with Core. App 4.0.0 must
require Core `^4.0` and lock the tested stable Core release. Publish Docs from
the same Core source and synchronized guides.

Core's Composer branch alias maps `dev-master` to `4.0.x-dev` for deliberate
development testing. Stable applications use `^4.0` and their committed lockfile.
When coordinating releases, publish Core first, then update App's stable lockfile
from the public distribution and verify App CI and a fresh project install.

## Branch Policy

`master` is the sole long-lived branch and carries ongoing Core 4.x
development. Version branches are not kept as release archives; existing
tags preserve published releases. Short-lived contribution branches may
be removed once their work is merged or otherwise preserved.

Publish releases with signed version tags. Applications should use tagged-version
constraints and keep their lockfiles; `dev-master` intentionally follows current
development and can introduce breaking changes during a major-version transition.

Only Core 4.x is maintained, as defined in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/phalcon-kit/core/blob/master/SECURITY.md).
All earlier versions are end of life: do not prepare maintenance releases or
security backports for them. Preserve their existing tags as historical records.

## Before Release

1. Confirm the target 4.x version and commit on `master`.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` by moving the current unreleased section to a dated
   version heading.
3. Update `src/Support/Version.php` and its focused version test to the exact
   release number.
4. Confirm the README and guides describe the release accurately.
5. Run the full local quality gate:

```shell
composer qa
```

6. Confirm Composer metadata:

```shell
composer validate --strict --no-check-publish
composer audit
```

7. Review public docs:
   - `README.md`
   - `CHANGELOG.md`
   - `SECURITY.md`
   - `SUPPORT.md`
   - `guides/`
8. When public or protected APIs changed, regenerate the API reference with
   `composer docs`, synchronize the generated API and guides into the Docs
   repository, and build the complete MkDocs site.
9. Check package contents:

```shell
composer archive --format=tar --dir=/tmp
```

Review the archive if package exclusions changed.

## Commit And CI

1. Review `git status --short`, the complete diff, and `git diff --check`.
2. Create and verify a signed release commit containing only the reviewed
   release changes.
3. Push the release commit to `master`.
4. Wait for every required workflow on that exact commit SHA. Do not tag while
   a required check is pending or failing.

## Tag And GitHub Release

Only after the exact release commit passes CI, create and verify a signed tag:

```shell
printf 'Release version: '
read -r VERSION
git tag -s "$VERSION" -m "Release $VERSION"
git verify-tag "$VERSION"
git push origin "$VERSION"
```

Create the GitHub Release from the verified tag with curated notes and the
correct previous-tag comparison link.

## After Release

1. Verify the GitHub Actions workflow passed on the tag and that the GitHub
   Release targets the expected commit SHA.
2. Verify Packagist updated `phalcon-kit/core` and resolves the exact tag SHA.
3. For the coordinated 4.0.0 launch, finish the App constraint/lockfile update,
   pass its exact-commit CI, publish its signed 4.0.0 tag, and verify a fresh
   public `composer create-project phalcon-kit/app:4.0.0` installation.
4. Publish the synchronized Docs commit and verify its GitHub Pages workflow.
5. Check GitHub Code Scanning for fresh Psalm results.
6. Confirm the old `zemit-cms/core` page still points users toward this
   repository for historical context.
7. Start a new unreleased section in `CHANGELOG.md` in the next development
   commit.

## Legacy Package

The old `zemit-cms/core` package is unmaintained and unsupported. Preserve it as
historical continuity for existing users; direct new documentation to Core 4.x.
If it is marked abandoned later, point users to `phalcon-kit/core`.

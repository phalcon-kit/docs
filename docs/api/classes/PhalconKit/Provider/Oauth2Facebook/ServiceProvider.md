Registers the Facebook OAuth2 provider.

Options are read from `oauth2.facebook`. The provider resolves the request
service to convert a configured relative `redirectUri` into an absolute URI
using the current scheme, host, and non-default port. It also resolves the
session service so OAuth state flows have an active session-backed context.

## Properties

### serviceName

Stable DI service name managed by this provider.

```php
protected string $serviceName
```

This value is part of the provider contract because controllers, tasks,
other injectables, and replacement providers resolve services by name.
Concrete providers must set it to a non-empty value.

***

## Methods

### register

Register the shared `oauth2Facebook` service.

```php
public register(\PhalconKit\Di\DiInterface $di): void
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type                           | Description |
|-----------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| `$di`     | **\PhalconKit\Di\DiInterface** |             |

**Throws:**

When required `session` or
`request` services are unavailable or have unexpected types.
- [`ServiceException`](../../Exception/ServiceException.md)

***

## Inherited methods

### __construct

Stores the DI container and prepares the provider for registration.

```php
public __construct(\PhalconKit\Di\DiInterface $di): mixed
```

The constructor intentionally requires `PhalconKit\Di\DiInterface` so
providers can rely on typed service helpers during configuration and
registration.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type                           | Description |
|-----------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| `$di`     | **\PhalconKit\Di\DiInterface** |             |

**Throws:**

When a concrete provider does not define a
non-empty service name.
- [`LogicException`](../../Exception/LogicException.md)

***

### getName

Returns the DI service name managed by this provider.

```php
public getName(): string
```

***

### boot

Optional post-registration hook.

```php
public boot(): void
```

The base implementation is intentionally empty. Custom bootstraps or
application code may call this method for provider-specific startup work
after all services have been registered.

***

### configure

Optional provider-local configuration hook.

```php
public configure(): void
```

This runs during construction after DI has been stored and before
`register()` is called. Use it to normalize provider options or prepare
lightweight state; service creation belongs in `register()`.
